# **Aapda Setu — Comprehensive Disaster Relief & Hospital Management System**

Aapda Setu is a comprehensive, real-time disaster relief and hospital management platform designed to streamline emergency response during natural or man-made disasters. It strengthens coordination between citizens, hospitals, authorities, and rescue organizations through an integrated digital ecosystem.

A Disaster Relief Hospital System is a coordinated medical response framework that ensures fast, organized, and effective treatment of victims during any disaster (natural or man-made). Its goal is to save maximum lives by providing immediate care, efficient resource use, and continuous communication.
Aapda Setu builds directly on this mission by offering a unified system that connects **real-time alerts**, **hospital availability**, **safe evacuation routes**, **verified news**, **geo-tagged reports**, and **transparent fundraiser tracking**—ensuring timely, reliable, and life-saving actions.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Detect – Early Hazard Identification**

Aapda Setu uses multiple authentic data sources to detect potential disasters before they escalate.
Data inputs are collected from:

* IMD (weather monitoring)
* CWC (water level monitoring)
* NCS (seismic activity tracking)
* USGS (global geological events)
* ISRO (satellite-based observation)

The detection system processes these inputs and identifies risks such as:

* Floods and flash floods
* Cyclones and strong windstorms
* Earthquakes
* Excess rainfall
* River water overflow
* Landslides

The platform’s risk engine evaluates threat levels, categorizes severity, and triggers timely alerts, ensuring citizens and authorities stay prepared.

### **2. Decide – Intelligent Decision Support System**

Once risks are detected, Aapda Setu helps decision-makers optimize their response through smart tools:

* Automatic suggestion of safe evacuation routes
* Real-time hospital and ICU bed availability
* Assessment of oxygen beds and ventilator capacity
* Identification of nearest operational shelters
* Prioritization of critical zones based on population density and hazard impact

By combining data-driven insights with live geographical information, authorities can allocate resources rapidly and effectively.

---

### **3. Act – Real-Time Response & Action Tools**

During active disasters, Aapda Setu transforms into a centralized action dashboard by offering:

* Instant mobile and dashboard disaster alerts
* Turn-by-turn navigation for safe evacuation pathways
* SOS triggering for immediate help
* Geo-tagged citizen incident reports with descriptions, photos, and hazard details
* Risk-zone mapping with heat layers

These tools ensure smooth coordination between rescue teams, hospitals, and citizens, reducing confusion and response delays.

---

### **4. Recover – Post-Disaster Rehabilitation & Transparency**

After the event, the platform focuses on recovery and accountability by providing:

* Verified fundraisers approved by trusted authorities
* Transparent aid distribution tracking
* Damage assessment reports
* Mapping of affected areas and impact analysis
* Resources for rebuilding assistance

This ensures trust, transparency, and efficient long-term disaster recovery.

---

## **Dashboard Highlights**

### **Pre-Detection Alerts – Predict & Prepare**

This module helps users remain prepared through:

* Multi-hazard filtering options
* Adjustable distance ranges (5–50 km)
* Location-aware alerts based on dynamic risk
* Visual representation of risk zones through heat-layer maps
* Severity levels including High, Medium, and Low risk

This ensures citizens receive context-aware warnings tailored to their surroundings.

---

### **Hospital Status – Real-Time Medical Availability**

This is one of the core sections of Aapda Setu focusing on medical support during disasters. It includes:

* ICU availability status
* Ventilator readiness
* Availability of oxygen-supported beds
* Emergency department operational visibility
* Hospital traffic indicators: Accepting, Limited, Full
* Distance to nearest hospitals
* Last-updated time for every medical center
* Interactive maps showing all facilities with color-coded markers

This helps patients, families, and authorities instantly identify the best available medical facility nearby.

---

### **Safe Houses & Evacuation Routes**

The platform highlights:

* Government-approved shelters
* Safe community centers
* Evacuation corridors and their real-time safety levels
* Integrated navigation powered by Mapbox
* Distance, capacity, and route difficulty metrics

This ensures people move safely and efficiently to secure locations.

---

### **News Detect – Verified Information Only**

This section filters misinformation and only displays:

* Verified disaster-related news
* Official bulletins from government agencies
* Important public advisories
* Updates on rescue progress
* Weather and geological updates

Reliable information is crucial during crises, and News Detect ensures citizens stay informed responsibly.

---

### **Geo-Reports – Community-Driven Incident Reporting**

Aapda Setu enables both citizens and officials to submit ground-level reports that include:

* Location (auto-detected)
* Description of the incident
* Photos or media proof
* Type of hazard
* Severity estimate

This crowd-sourced reporting strengthens situational awareness and speeds up rescue efforts.

---

### **Fundraiser Verification – Only Trusted Causes**

Aapda Setu ensures transparency by listing only:

* Government-verified donation campaigns
* Authentic NGO-led fundraisers
* Relief funds for affected districts
* Real-time donation progress

This prevents fraud and ensures help reaches the right people.

---

### **Do’s & Don’ts – Disaster Safety Education**

Contains guidelines for disasters such as:

* Floods
* Cyclones
* Earthquakes
* Landslides
* Fires

Each guideline explains what to do, what to avoid, and how to protect yourself and others.
